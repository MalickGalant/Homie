  <!-- ## The animation -->
  <!--
    We want to show a snackbar that disappears after a few seconds. This could be easily accomplished by adding a CSS class using `amp-bind` to show the snackbar and then using CSS animations to hide the snackbar after a few seconds. However, with this approach it's not possible to trigger the snackbar multiple times (the newly added CSS class won't disappear).

    We can solve this problem by using the [`amp-animation`](content/amp-dev/documentation/components/reference/amp-animation)  extension, which makes it possible to execute animations repeatedly. We define an animation that will slide-in the snackbar and then hide it after a few seconds using the `offset` attribute to time the different keyframes.
  -->
  <amp-animation id="snackbarSlideIn" layout="nodisplay">
    <script type="application/json">
      [{
        "duration": "3s",
        "fill": "both",
        "easing": "ease-out",
        "iterations": "1",
        "selector": ".snackbar",
        "keyframes": [{
            "transform": "translateY(100%)"
          },
          {
            "transform": "translateY(0)", "offset": 0.1
          },
          {
            "transform": "translateY(0)", "offset": 0.9
          },

          {
            "transform": "translateY(100%)"
          }
        ]
      }
      ]
    </script>
  </amp-animation>

  <!-- ## The snackbar -->
  <!-- Our snackbar is a `div` containing the message. It's going to disappear after a few seconds so we don't provide any additional buttons to manually hide the snackbar. The text message is bound to an `amp-state` variable to make it's content configurable. This is not needed if the snackbar should always show the same message. -->
  <div class="snackbar" [text]="message">
    Hello World
  </div>

  <!-- ## The trigger -->
  <!-- The snackbar animation is triggered via the `restart` action: `on="tap:snackbarSlideIn.restart"`. We use the `restart` action to make it possible to override an already active animation. The input field simply updates the `amp-state` variable containing the snackbar's message. -->
  <div class="trigger">
    <input on="input-debounced:AMP.setState({message: event.value})" value="Hello World">
    <button on="tap:snackbarSlideIn.restart">
      Show Snackbar
    </button>
  </div>
</body>
